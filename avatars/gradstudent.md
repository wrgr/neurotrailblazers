Maya always straddled two worlds—equally at home in math class and psych lab. She’s now in year 2 of her PhD, building segmentation models and explaining PCA to undergrads.

She loves when code makes neurons “pop” into clarity. She's not always sure her work counts when she’s not slicing brains or running gels—but she's finding her place.

### Inner Conflict:
- Wants to help others but worries she’s still too new herself
- Torn between staying in academia or joining a neurotech startup
- Feels pressure to always be “the explainer” in cross-disciplinary settings

### Journey Markers:
- Published reusable Jupyter template for EM visualization
- Presented on model error modes at a neuroML workshop
- Started mentoring Julian—and learned as much as she taught

### Growth Path:
- Learns to embrace partial knowledge
- Gains feedback literacy through peer review
- Realizes her impact comes from enabling others as much as producing code
