Dr. Nguyen has always moved forward—quickly. From valedictorian to PhD to postdoc, she’s led with clarity. But now, managing data releases, peer mentorship, and grant deadlines, she wonders: what’s next?

She thrives when ideas snap together. But leadership is lonely, and good science often feels at odds with fast science. She’s seen too many teams collapse under pressure.

### Inner Conflict:
- Misses days of deep solo work
- Balancing perfectionism with people-first practices
- Feels isolated as expectations rise

### Journey Markers:
- Wrote lab’s first FAIR-compliant annotation protocol
- Mentored 3 students through their first conference posters
- Organized cross-lab proofreading challenge to align standards

### Growth Path:
- Sees that leading *is* science
- Embraces collaboration as her core contribution
- Writes grant proposals that prioritize mentorship alongside aims
