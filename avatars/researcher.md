Amir came from the world of edge devices and object tracking. But when he saw a 3D fly brain reconstructed by a global team, he knew: this was the next frontier.

He’s fluent in models and metrics, but unsure what a dendrite *means*. And he’s learning that science doesn’t move like startups do. But the challenge—that's the hook.

### Inner Conflict:
- Struggles to read dense neuro papers
- Unsure when to push his tech or adapt it
- Wants to contribute but not overstep

### Journey Markers:
- Tuned a transformer model for segment consistency
- Co-created a dashboard with a neuro postdoc to evaluate proofread merges
- Gave a talk that helped PIs understand model bias

### Growth Path:
- Learns from questions, not just answers
- Redefines “impact” from speed to depth
- Bridges cultures without diluting either
