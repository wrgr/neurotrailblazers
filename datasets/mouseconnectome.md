# MouseConnects: Complete Hippocampal Connectome

**NIH BRAIN Initiative â€¢ $40M Project â€¢ 2023â€“2028**

A synapse-level reconstruction of 10 mmÂ³ of the mouse hippocampal formation â€“ revolutionizing our understanding of memory circuits.

---

## Overview

MouseConnects is a landmark effort to map the hippocampus at nanometer resolution. It is the most ambitious connectomics project to date, producing an open-access dataset for the global neuroscience community.

### Key Innovations

- **mSEM-IBEAM Technology**: Combines multibeam electron microscopy with ion beam milling.
- **Distributed Imaging**: Multiple sites working in parallel for massive-scale data collection.
- **AI-Powered Reconstruction**: State-of-the-art segmentation using deep learning.
- **Open Science**: All data and tools made freely available.

### Scientific Questions Addressed

- How do hippocampal circuits encode spatial information and episodic memories?
- What microcircuit motifs support place and grid cell function?
- How do different cell types contribute to memory formation?
- What are the organizational principles of the hippocampal network?
