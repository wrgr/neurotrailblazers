This section introduces two core training frameworks used throughout NeuroTrailblazers:

### MERIT Model

- **M**entoring Exceptional Researchers to Innovate and Thrive â€” a six-stage approach that mirrors the scientific method from selection through career transition.
- **Stages:** Selection, Orientation, Skill Development, Independent Research, Advanced Research, Career Transition.
- **Evidence base:** Lopatto (2007) on undergraduate research experiences and Duckworth et al. (2007) on persistence.

### COMPASS Model

- Interactive workshops that demystify the hidden curriculum from orientation to future planning.
- Integrates Fadel et al. (2015) four-dimensional education: knowledge, skills, character, and meta-learning.

Both frameworks complement each other: MERIT structures your research journey while COMPASS offers workshops that develop resilience and professional habits.
