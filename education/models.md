This section introduces two core training frameworks used throughout NeuroTrailblazers:

### MERIT Model

- **M**entoring Exceptional Researchers to Innovate and Thrive. It follows the scientific method from merit-based selection through career transition.
- Stages: Selection, Orientation, Skill Development, Independent Research, Advanced Research, Career Transition.
- Anchored in evidence from Lopatto (2007) on undergraduate research experiences and Duckworth et al. (2007) on persistence.

### COMPASS Model

- Ten interactive workshops covering the hidden curriculum from orientation to future planning.
- Integrates Fadel et al. (2015) four-dimensional education dimensions of knowledge, skills, character, and meta-learning.

Both frameworks complement each other: MERIT structures your research journey while COMPASS offers workshops that develop resilience and professional habits.
