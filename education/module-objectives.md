## Module 3 – Experimental Techniques
- Summarize methods for sample preparation and electron microscopy.
- Compare imaging resolutions and trade-offs for different use cases.
- Outline steps for data management and quality control.
- Practice documenting protocols for reproducibility.

## Module 4 – Data Analysis and Interpretation
- Use basic Python notebooks to explore connectomics data sets.
- Interpret segmentation outputs and common error modes.
- Apply the COMPASS model to reflect on personal growth during analysis.
- Communicate findings in figures and short reports.

## Module 5 – Sharing and Collaborating
