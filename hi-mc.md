# üß† High-throughput Imaging for Mouse Connectomics (HI-MC)

The **High-throughput Imaging for Mouse Connectomics (HI-MC)** project is a flagship NIH CONNECTS initiative focused on mapping **10&nbsp;mm¬≥ of mouse hippocampus**, demonstrating scalable, synapse-resolution imaging. NeuroTrailblazers serves as the training and engagement platform that connects students directly to this ambitious scientific effort.

## üî¨ Project Vision

HI-MC aims to demonstrate how a focused 10&nbsp;mm¬≥ hippocampal dataset can pave the way toward a future whole-brain connectome. Using advanced imaging pipelines and cross-institutional collaboration‚Äîwith a focus on **scalability**, **rigor**, and **inclusive participation**‚ÄîHI-MC integrates cutting-edge imaging, segmentation, proofreading, and circuit modeling into one seamless workflow.

## üß© The Connectomics Pipeline

HI-MC integrates contributions from multiple world-class teams across the following pipeline:

1. **Tissue Preparation & Embedding**  
   Harvard, Princeton

2. **High-throughput Imaging (mSEM / ATUM)**  
   APL, Harvard, Cambridge

3. **Image Alignment and Stitching**  
   APL, Google, Princeton

4. **Segmentation & Annotation**  
   Google, MIT, Allen Institute

5. **Proofreading & Quality Control**  
   NeuroTrailblazers students, cloud-based tools

6. **Graph Extraction & Circuit Modeling**  
   MIT, Allen Institute, Harvard

## üéì Student Contributions

Students participating through NeuroTrailblazers directly support:

- Proofreading and editing neural reconstructions using real data
- Detecting and correcting merge and split errors in segmentation
- Analyzing synapse connectivity patterns
- Building or evaluating tools for scalable analysis
- Working within open-source, cloud-hosted systems (e.g., Neuroglancer, CloudVolume)

These contributions are critical to producing an accurate, scalable map of the mouse brain and are integrated with structured training modules via the MERIT model.

## üåç Partner Institutions

HI-MC is a multi-institutional collaboration involving:

- Harvard University
- Johns Hopkins APL
- Princeton University
- MIT
- Allen Institute for Brain Science
- Google Research
- University of Cambridge

## üß≠ How This Supports NIH CONNECTS

HI-MC advances the goals of NIH CONNECTS by:

- Providing hands-on research training to diverse and emerging scientists
- Demonstrating scalable, reproducible connectomics pipelines
- Integrating pedagogy and mentorship with high-value data generation

Students trained through NeuroTrailblazers are not just observers ‚Äî they are contributors to a national-scale neuroscience initiative.
