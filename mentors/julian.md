Julian grew up in the Appalachian foothills in a close-knit community where college was rare and family came first. His parents are supportive, but puzzled—“Why do you miss Thanksgiving for lab?” they ask.

He’s the first in his family to go to college. Everything about research feels foreign—from pipettes to peer review. But something about mapping a brain just *makes sense*. Seeing images of neurons feels like finding constellations. He wants to matter here. To get a foot in the door.

### Inner Conflict:
- Caught between home obligations and lab demands
- Unsure if he “sounds smart enough” in journal club
- Works nights to support himself, leaving little time for coding practice

### Journey Markers:
- Started as a participant in a summer cohort
- First success proofreading glial segmentation
- Told his uncle: “I'm helping map how a mouse thinks.” His uncle actually smiled.

### Growth Path:
- Gains confidence by mentoring high school visitors
- Learns Python basics by copying and tweaking analysis notebooks
- Finds community in his cohort
