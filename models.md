## 🧹 CCR Model

**Center for Curriculum Redesign – 21st Century Competency Framework**

The **CCR** model underpins both MERIT and COMPASS by promoting **whole-learner development** across four domains:

<div class="ccr-boxes">

### 🧠 Knowledge

Core domain expertise, including neuroscience, data science, and research methods.

### 🛠 Skills

Transferable abilities like critical thinking, problem solving, communication, and collaboration.

### 🧬 Character

Traits like curiosity, resilience, integrity, and leadership — essential for ethical, meaningful work.

### ↺ Meta-Learning

“Learning how to learn” — planning, self-reflection, adaptation, and embracing complexity.
