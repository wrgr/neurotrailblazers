## Overview

Welcome to the first step in your NeuroTrailblazers journey. This module introduces the core mission of the NeuroTrailblazers initiative and the exciting field of connectomics. You'll explore why understanding the brain’s wiring matters, how large-scale mapping projects like MICrONS and H01 work, and what tools and skills you’ll gain throughout this curriculum.

## SMART Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* **Describe** the goals of connectomics and how it fits within modern neuroscience. *(Bloom: Remember, Understand)*
* **Identify** major connectomics datasets and their characteristics. *(Bloom: Understand)*
* **Recognize** the purpose and structure of the NeuroTrailblazers platform. *(Bloom: Remember)*

## Training Goals

* Inspire students to pursue curiosity-driven discovery in neuroscience.
* Establish the value of interdisciplinary learning across neuroscience, computation, and ethics.
* Familiarize learners with key resources and concepts that recur in later modules.

## Key Resources

* [I Am My Connectome – Sebastian Seung (TED)](https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_seung_i_am_my_connectome)
* [MICrONS Project Overview](https://www.microns-explorer.org/)
* [FlyWire Dataset from Princeton/HHMI Janelia](https://flywire.ai/)

## Sample Colab Notebook
