### 🧪 Sample Interactive Tools:

* [Neuroglancer](https://neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/)
* [FlyWire Viewer](https://flywire.ai)
* [MICrONS Explorer](https://www.microns-explorer.org)

### 🎓 COMPASS Integration:

* **Knowledge:** Understand how data is organized and labeled for analysis
* **Skills:** Navigate viewers, identify structures, interpret metadata
* **Character:** Patience, attention to detail, and openness to uncertainty
* **Meta-Learning:** Learn how tools and pipelines evolve across datasets

### 📚 References & Resources:

* **Kasthuri et al., 2015**, Cell – "Saturated reconstruction of neocortex"

### ✅ Assessment:

* Match dataset types to pipeline stages (e.g., segmentation → labeled volume)
* Navigate a dataset and find one synapse, one neuron, and one glial cell
* Write a 3–4 sentence description of how segmentation is performed and why it matters
