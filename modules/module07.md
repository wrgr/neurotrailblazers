    <h2>ðŸ”— Circuits as Graphs</h2>
    <p>Connectomics datasets can be transformed into graphs, where nodes represent neurons and edges represent synapses. This abstraction allows mathematical analysis of the brain's structure using tools from graph theory.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Graph basics: nodes, edges, adjacency matrices</li>
      <li>Directed vs. undirected graphs</li>
      <li>Weighted edges and multilayer networks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ðŸ“ˆ Network Metrics</h2>
    <p>Network theory provides powerful tools for quantifying connectivity. Key metrics help identify structural features of circuits, such as hubs, communities, and bottlenecks.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Degree distribution and centrality</li>
      <li>Path length and clustering coefficient</li>
      <li>Network motifs and modularity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ðŸ§® Connectomics in Context</h2>
    <p>Analyzing neural networks allows us to draw comparisons across species and systems. Biological networks may exhibit small-world or scale-free properties, and can be contrasted with artificial networks.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Small-world and scale-free architectures</li>
      <li>Comparing biological vs. artificial networks</li>
      <li>Limitations of network abstraction</li>
