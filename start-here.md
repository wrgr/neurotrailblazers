Welcome to the **Start Here** guide. This orientation walks you through the MERIT framework and helps you plan your path.

1. **Understand the connectomics pipeline.** Learn how our Hi-MC workflow maps onto the MERIT stages from question formation to communication.
2. **Select your starting point.** Whether you're new or experienced, the modules are organized so you can jump in where it makes sense.
3. **Connect with mentors.** Our archetype mentors share tips for common challenges. Get paired with Julian, Layla, or Elias for guidance.
4. **Track your progress.** Use the checklist at the end of each module to monitor your learning objectives.
