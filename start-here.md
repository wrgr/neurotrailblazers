# Welcome to NeuroTrailblazers

NeuroTrailblazers is your entry point into the dynamic and expanding field of nanoscale connectomics â€” the science of mapping the brain at the level of synapses and circuits. This platform is designed to support undergraduate and graduate students as they explore neuroscience, data science, and imaging through real-world research.

## ðŸŒŸ Our Mission

We aim to identify and support the next generation of scientific leaders by expanding access to rigorous, high-impact training in neuroscience, data science, and advanced imaging. Our programs provide immersive experiences that accelerate learning, build confidence, and prepare participants to lead in scientific discovery.

Through initiatives like **NeuroTrailblazers** and the **HI-MC effort** (High-throughput Imaging for Mouse Connectomics), participants gain access to world-class research environments, mentorship from active scientists, and hands-on engagement with real data and tools. Training is integrated with authentic scientific challengesâ€”such as reconstructing neural circuits from electron microscopyâ€”ensuring that learning is anchored in meaningful, cutting-edge work.

We measure success by the strength of scientific contributions, the growth of durable skills, and the advancement of participants toward impactful careers in STEM.

## ðŸ§­ What You'll Find Here

NeuroTrailblazers includes:

- **Modular Curriculum**: 15 learning modules aligned with Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy, including Jupyter notebooks and guided lessons.
- **Scientist Archetypes**: Follow the journeys of Julian (undergrad), Layla (grad student), and Elias (postdoc) through our mentorship framework.
- **Frameworks for Success**: Learn through the MERIT and COMPASS frameworks â€” evidence-based, scalable systems for growing research excellence.
- **Real Datasets**: Engage with open, cutting-edge neuroscience datasets including MICrONS, FlyWire, H01, and SNEMI3D.
- **Interactive Tools**: A course generator, chatbot mentors, and project-based activities are in development to support your progress.

## ðŸ”¬ Our Research Foundation

NeuroTrailblazers is part of the NIH CONNECTS-supported **HI-MC project**, a multi-institutional effort to build a scalable connectomics pipeline capable of mapping the entire mouse brain. Students participating in this program contribute to:

- Proofreading neural reconstructions
- Learning connectome data analysis
- Building tools and conducting research that scales
- Advancing the future of brain mapping

This work is anchored by rigorous science and a national-scale collaboration between institutions including Harvard, Princeton, JHU/APL, the Allen Institute, MIT, and Cambridge.
