### üë§ About Dr. Jeff Lichtman

Have a burning question about the brain? Curious about how we map billions of synapses in a cubic millimeter? Our expert AI is modeled after insights and public materials from **Dr. Jeff Lichtman**, a pioneering figure in the field of connectomics and a PI on our HI-MC grant.

**Jeff W. Lichtman, MD, PhD** is the Jeremy R. Knowles Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. A leading voice in neuroscience, he is renowned for developing groundbreaking imaging technologies and leading large-scale brain mapping initiatives.

Dr. Lichtman's work focuses on the **connectome**‚Äîthe complete map of neural connections in the brain. He has been instrumental in developing **Brainbow** imaging and in advancing large-volume electron microscopy to reconstruct neural circuits with unprecedented precision.

He is a co-lead of the **Harvard-Mouse Connectome Project (HI-MC)**, which aims to chart 10 mm¬≥ of mouse hippocampal brain tissue in full EM resolution.

üî¨ His research has been featured in major outlets like *The New York Times*, *Nature*, and *Science*, and his lectures on neuroanatomy, plasticity, and connectomics have influenced a generation of scientists.
