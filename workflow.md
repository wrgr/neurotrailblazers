title: Hi-MC Workflow
---

The **High-Information Morphological Connectomics (Hi-MC)** workflow guides you from raw EM images to publishable insights.

1. **Acquisition** – collect or source data from public datasets like MICrONS or FlyWire.
2. **Segmentation** – apply automated and manual techniques to define neurons.
3. **Proofreading** – ensure accuracy through collaborative review.
4. **Analysis** – quantify circuits using tools such as Python notebooks.
5. **Dissemination** – share results and contribute to open science repositories.

Each step aligns with MERIT:
- **Stage 1–2**: Learn background and find mentors.
- **Stage 3**: Develop segmentation and analysis skills.
- **Stage 4–5**: Conduct independent experiments and network with experts.
- **Stage 6**: Publish and plan your next career move.
